# Fintech-Project-1

This is Jason. The new branch I have created is called the project-one.

To receive the branch, use "git fetch -all" and then "git branch" to checkout the branch in your local file.

Don't forget to be in the branch before pushing.

We will make a good project! Let's go!!!




## New Addition to the File

I have output both BTC and ETH files and create few graphs for the ppt for now.

More pngs can be output after Tuesday class.

The covid file will be analyzed tommorrow morning.

Let's go!!!



## Last Edition to the file - 2020/11/16

Code rerun again to make sure the codes actually works!

All the graphs that was used in the ppt with wrong titles or legends were fixed.

PPT is updated with the same version that was used in presentation. 

This project is so fun, can't wait for the next one with more knowledge in ML!!!
